#Simon Game

![simon](images/simon.PNG)

Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory.

The game has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the game. A round in the game consists of the game lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases. (This is only one of the games on the game; there are actually other games on the original.

I hope you enjoy it!
